Psi4Education is the education and outreach program of Psi4, the free, open-source quantum chemistry software package.  We offer a suite of free, open-source lab activities, suitable for use in classes across the chemistry curriculum, which use Psi4, the Psi4Numpy Python API, and WebMO, a graphical front end to help build molecules and set up calculations for Psi4.  Psi4Education aims to increase students exposure to scientific programming and computational chemistry and help students learn chemistry through computation.

## Getting Started

__[Installing Psi4 and Jupyter notebook]({{< ref "psi4education_setup.md">}})__ Instructions for installing psi4 in a conda environment suitable for the Psi4Numpy Jupyter notebook labs.

__[About Psi4Education Jupyter Labs]({{< ref "psi4jupyter_labs.md" >}})__
Many of the lab activities use [Psi4Numpy](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy), the Psi4 Python API.  Psi4Numpy allows you to import and use Psi4 functions directly in Jupyter notebooks.  These labs assume some prerequisite knowledge of python.  See [this page]({{< ref "psi4jupyter_labs.md" >}}) for an explanation of these prerequisites.  If you need resources to learn these prerequisite skills, we recommend [these lessons](https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/) from the Molecular Sciences Software Institute.  Lessons 1, 4, and 5 cover all of the prerequisite skills needed.

__[No Computing Resources? No Problem!]({{< ref "psi4edu_chemcompute.md" >}})__ Psi4Education has partnered with [ChemCompute](https://chemcompute.org/) to enable you to run Psi4Education Jupyter notebook labs using FREE compute resources through ChemCompute.  You do not have to install or configure any software on your own computer. It's easy to sign up and get started. [Learn more.]({{< ref "psi4edu_chemcompute.md" >}})

__[Can we visually predict binding energies?](https://github.com/Psi4Education/psi4education/blob/master/labs/CationPi/CationPi_student.pdf)__
The role that visual depictions play in a student's understanding of abstract concepts can be quite substantial. This laboratory exercise depicts the density of the electron cloud around various aromatic systems. The students introduce a sodium cation into the system in a place that makes sense based on the location of the most electron density. The students are asked to make a semi-quantitative connection between what they are seeing in the electrostatic potential and the ultimate strength of the cationic binding energy. \\

__[When does water become OH + H? (A study in molecular orbitals)](https://github.com/Psi4Education/psi4education/blob/master/labs/water_MO/waterMO_student.pdf)__
Molecular orbitals are the basis for bonding, the very essence of chemistry. In this laboratory, the students will create the water molecule and then begin to dissociate it in order to understand how bonding and molecular orbitals overlap. This lab can be done in conjunction with the PIB Molecular Orbitals lab to make a longer lab on molecular orbitals. \\

The particle-in-a-box model has long been used to explain the electronic absorption of linear carbon chains. This lab invites the student to explore this phenomenon within the realm of the molecular orbitals that allow the transitions to take place. This lab can be done in conjunction with the H2O Molecular Lab to make a longer, more traditional lab assignment. Further questions can be added by the instructor to augment the exercises incorporated herein. \\

__[What is symmetry in chemistry?](https://github.com/Psi4Education/psi4education/blob/master/labs/Symmetry/Symmetry_student.pdf)__
Symmetry is often a difficult concept for chemistry students to grasp without some type of visual or tangible tool. This laboratory aims to give students experience with immediate feedback in order to give them instantaneous and formative assessment of their skills. The students will perform designated tasks of assigning point group symmetries to given molecules as well as the converse where they must provide examples of molecules for certain point group symmetries. \\
